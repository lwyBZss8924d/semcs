## [0.5.3] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- **`.ccignore` file support**: Automatic creation of `.ccignore` file with sensible defaults for persistent exclusion patterns
- **Media file exclusions**: Images (png, jpg, gif, svg, etc.), videos (mp4, avi, mov, etc.), and audio files (mp3, wav, flac, etc.) excluded by default
- **Config file exclusions**: JSON and YAML files excluded from indexing by default to reduce noise in search results
- **`--no-ccignore` flag**: Option to bypass `.ccignore` patterns when needed
- **Persistent patterns**: Exclusion patterns persist across searches without needing command-line flags each time
