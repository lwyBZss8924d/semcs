# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- **Enhanced token-based chunking**: Implemented model-specific token-aware chunking using HuggingFace tokenizers for precise token counting instead of character estimation
- **Model-specific configurations**: Chunks now sized according to model capacity - 1024 tokens for large models (nomic/jina) vs 400 tokens for small models (bge-small)
- **Streamlined --inspect command**: Enhanced file inspection showing token counts per chunk, language detection, and clean visualization without visual noise
- **FastEmbed capacity utilization**: Configured FastEmbed to use full model capacity (8192 tokens for nomic/jina models vs previous 512 token truncation)
- **Indexing progress transparency**: Added model name and chunk configuration display during indexing operations

### Fixed
- **Token estimation accuracy**: Replaced rough character-based estimation with actual model tokenizers for precise chunking
- **Model capacity underutilization**: Fixed FastEmbed configuration to use full 8K context for large models instead of 512-token default

- **Unused code cleanup**: Removed dead code and properly annotated intentional allowances for CI compliance

### Technical
- **HuggingFace tokenizer integration**: Added hf-hub and tokenizers dependencies for precise token counting
- **Model-aware chunking system**: `get_model_chunk_config()` function providing balanced precision vs context chunking strategy
- **Enhanced --inspect visualization**: Complete rewrite showing essential chunking information without progress bar clutter

## [0.4.4] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed
- **`--add` command argument parsing**: Fixed issue where file paths were incorrectly parsed as pattern arguments, preventing single file additions to the index
- **Empty pattern behavior**: Empty regex patterns now match each line once (consistent with grep/ripgrep) instead of matching at every character position causing massive duplication

## [0.4.3] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- **Enhanced embedding models**: Added support for Nomic V1.5 (8192 tokens, 768 dimensions) and Jina Code (8192 tokens, code-specialized) models
- **Model selection**: New `--model` flag for choosing embedding model during indexing (`bge-small`, `nomic-v1.5`, `jina-code`)
- **Index-time model configuration**: Model selection is now properly configured at index creation time and stored in index manifest
- **Automatic model detection**: Search operations automatically use the model stored in the index manifest
- **Reranking support**: Added cross-encoder reranking with `--rerank` flag and `--rerank-model` option for improved search relevance
- **Striding for large chunks**: Implemented text striding with overlap for chunks exceeding model token limits
- **Token estimation**: Added token counting utilities to optimize chunk sizes for different models

### Fixed
- **Ctrl-C interrupt handling**: Fixed issue where indexing could not be properly cancelled - now uses `try_for_each` to stop all parallel workers immediately
- **Model compatibility checking**: Index operations now validate model compatibility and provide clear error messages for mismatches

### Technical
- **Model registry system**: New `ck-models` crate with centralized model configuration and limits
- **Index manifest enhancement**: Added `embedding_model` and `embedding_dimensions` fields to track model used for indexing
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing indexes without model metadata continue to work with default BGE model

- **Semantic search pollution**: Eliminated `.git` files appearing in semantic search results for unrelated queries
- **Index size reduction**: Significantly reduced index size by properly excluding hidden files and directories

### Technical
- **WalkBuilder configuration**: Changed `.hidden(false)` to `.hidden(true)` to respect hidden file conventions
