# TUI (Interactive) Mode

The TUI (Text User Interface) provides a beautiful, interactive search experience with live results and code preview. This reference covers all features, keyboard shortcuts, and technical details of the TUI mode.

## Overview

The TUI mode transforms `cc` into a visual, interactive search tool that provides:
- **Live search results** as you type
- **Multiple preview modes** for understanding code context
- **Semantic, regex, and hybrid search** modes switchable with a keypress
- **Keyboard-driven navigation** for efficiency
- **Syntax highlighting** and code structure visualization

The TUI is designed for:
- **Code discovery**: Learning how a codebase works
- **Finding implementations**: Locating specific patterns or concepts
- **Comparing approaches**: Seeing different implementations side-by-side
- **Quick exploration**: Rapid iteration on search queries

---

## Launching the TUI

### Basic Launch

```bash
# Start interactive search in current directory
cc --tui .

# Start in a specific directory
cc --tui src/
```

### Launch with Initial Query

```bash
# Start with semantic search
cc --tui --sem "error handling" src/

# Start with regex pattern
cc --tui --regex "fn \w+_test" .

# Start with hybrid search
cc --tui --hybrid "timeout" .
```

### Launch Behavior

- First search in a directory creates an index (~1-2 seconds for medium repos)
- Subsequent searches are instant (uses cached index)
- TUI respects `.gitignore` and `.ccignore` files
- Defaults to semantic search mode

---

## Search Modes

### Semantic Mode (`s`)

**What it does:**
Searches by meaning and concept, not exact text matches. Uses AI embeddings to understand code semantics.

**Example queries:**
```
"error handling"          → Finds: try/catch, Result<>, match arms, panic!
"database connection pool" → Finds: connection management code
"retry mechanism"          → Finds: backoff, retry loops, circuit breakers
"authentication logic"     → Finds: login, auth middleware, token validation
```

**When to use:**
- Finding concepts across different implementations
- Discovering similar patterns written differently
- Learning how something is done in the codebase
- Broad exploration of unfamiliar code
- Finding code that does X without knowing the exact function names

**Strengths:**
- Finds conceptually similar code even with different terminology
- Great for cross-language patterns
- Discovers unexpected implementations
- Excellent for learning and exploration

**Limitations:**
- Requires index (1-2 second initial cost)
- Less precise for exact syntax patterns
- May return semantically similar but functionally different code

**Result scoring:**
- 0.9-1.0: Extremely relevant, likely exactly what you want
- 0.8-0.9: Highly relevant, strong semantic match
- 0.7-0.8: Relevant, worth reviewing
- 0.6-0.7: Potentially relevant, may be tangential
- Below 0.6: Weak match, probably not what you want

---

### Regex Mode (`r`)

**What it does:**
Classic grep-style pattern matching with full regex support. Searches exact text patterns.

**Example queries:**
```
"fn \w+_test"              → Finds: fn test_parse, fn integration_test
"TODO|FIXME"               → Finds: TODO and FIXME comments
"impl .* for"              → Finds: trait implementations in Rust
"async fn.*Error"          → Finds: async functions returning errors
```

**When to use:**
- Finding exact patterns or syntax
- Searching for specific identifiers
- Looking for TODOs, FIXMEs, or other markers
- Performance-critical searches (no indexing)
- Very large codebases where indexing is slow

**Strengths:**
- No indexing required (instant startup)
- Precise pattern matching
- Full regex power (capture groups, lookahead, etc.)
- Familiar to grep/ripgrep users

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't understand code semantics
- Won't find semantically similar but textually different code
- Requires knowing exact patterns to search for

**Pattern syntax:**
- Uses Rust regex crate (similar to PCRE)
- Case-sensitive by default (use `(?i)` for case-insensitive)
- Supports: `.*`, `\w+`, `\d+`, `[a-z]`, `(group)`, etc.

---

### Hybrid Mode (`h`)

**What it does:**
Combines semantic ranking with keyword filtering. Results must contain your keyword but are ranked by semantic relevance.

**Example queries:**
```
"timeout"                  → Finds: Code with "timeout" keyword, ranked by relevance
"connect"                  → Finds: Code with "connect", prioritizes connection logic
"parse"                    → Finds: Code with "parse", ranks parsing functions higher
```

**When to use:**
- You know a keyword but want semantic ranking
- Filtering broad semantic searches to specific terms
- Balance between precision and semantic understanding
- Best of both worlds approach

**Strengths:**
- More precise than pure semantic (keyword filter)
- Better ranking than pure regex (semantic scores)
- Good for narrowing semantic results

**Limitations:**
- Still requires indexing
- Less flexible than full regex
- Keyword must appear exactly (no fuzzy matching)

**How it works:**
1. First pass: Regex filter for keyword
2. Second pass: Semantic ranking of filtered results
3. Results: Only files with keyword, sorted by relevance

---

## Preview Modes

### Chunks Mode

**What it shows:**
The matched code chunk with semantic boundaries, showing complete functions, classes, or logical blocks.

**Visual example:**
```rust
┌─ function handle_request • 45 tokens ─┐
│                                        │
│  async fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
│      let result = match req.method {
│          Method::GET => handle_get(req).await?,
│          Method::POST => handle_post(req).await?,
│          Method::DELETE => handle_delete(req).await?,
│          _ => return Err(Error::MethodNotAllowed),
│      };
│      Ok(result)
│  }
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Shows chunk boundaries with tree-sitter precision
- Displays chunk type (function, class, method, struct, etc.)
- Shows token count estimates (useful for LLM context)
- Breadcrumbs for nested code (e.g., "impl MyStruct > fn new")
- Syntax highlighting
- Automatic boundary detection

**Best for:**
- Understanding code structure
- Finding specific functions or methods
- Seeing complete logical units
- Getting ready-to-copy code blocks
- Understanding scope and boundaries

**Technical details:**
- Uses tree-sitter for precise syntax boundaries
- Respects language-specific structure (functions, classes, etc.)
- Falls back to heuristic chunking for unsupported languages
- Chunk size: Configurable, typically 100-500 tokens

---

### Heatmap Mode

**What it shows:**
Colors code lines by semantic relevance to your query, showing which specific lines are most relevant.

**Visual example:**
```
│ 🟢  pub fn process_timeout(duration: Duration) -> Result<()> {  (0.95)
│ 🟢      let elapsed = start.elapsed();                          (0.89)
│ 🟡      if elapsed > duration {                                 (0.72)
│ 🟡          log::warn!("Operation timed out");                  (0.68)
│ 🟠          return Err(Error::Timeout);                         (0.58)
│ ⚪      }                                                        (0.35)
│ ⚪      Ok(())                                                   (0.28)
│ ⚪  }                                                            (0.15)
```

**Color Scale:**
- 🟢 **Bright Green** (0.875-1.0): Extremely relevant, core match
- 🟢 **Green** (0.75-0.875): Highly relevant, strong match
- 🟡 **Yellow** (0.625-0.75): Moderately relevant, supporting code
- 🟠 **Orange** (0.5-0.625): Somewhat relevant, contextual
- ⚪ **Gray** (0-0.5): Low relevance, boilerplate or unrelated

**Features:**
- Line-by-line relevance scoring
- Visual gradient showing importance
- Exact relevance scores displayed
- Helps identify the most important lines in a file
- Great for skimming large results

**Best for:**
- Finding the most relevant lines within a file
- Understanding what specifically matched your query
- Comparing different implementations
- Identifying key lines in large files
- Skipping boilerplate to find core logic

**Technical details:**
- Each line gets individual embedding similarity score
- Scores are relative to your search query
- Color thresholds are fixed for consistency
- Works best with semantic and hybrid search

---

### Full File Mode

**What it shows:**
The complete file with syntax highlighting and scrolling capability.

**Visual example:**
```rust
// File: src/config.rs (Line 1-50 of 234)

use std::time::Duration;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Configuration for the application
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct Config {
    /// Request timeout in milliseconds
    pub timeout: Duration,
    /// Maximum retry attempts
    pub max_retries: u32,
    /// Enable debug logging
    pub debug: bool,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn new(timeout_ms: u64) -> Self {
        Self {
            timeout: Duration::from_millis(timeout_ms),
            max_retries: 3,
            debug: false,
        }
    }

    pub fn with_retries(mut self, retries: u32) -> Self {
        self.max_retries = retries;
        self
    }
}

// ... rest of file (scroll to see more) ...
```

**Features:**
- Full syntax highlighting
- Scrollable with `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k`
- Automatically jumps to matched line
- Shows file path and current line range
- Great for seeing complete context
- Respects language-specific syntax

**Best for:**
- Understanding how matched code fits in the larger file
- Seeing imports, dependencies, and context
- Reading complete implementations
- Understanding file structure
- Finding related code nearby

**Controls in full-file mode:**
- `j` / `↓`: Scroll down one line
- `k` / `↑`: Scroll up one line
- `Ctrl+d`: Scroll down half page
- `Ctrl+u`: Scroll up half page
- `f`: Toggle back to chunks mode
- `m`: Cycle to chunks or heatmap mode

**Technical details:**
- Loads entire file into memory
- Syntax highlighting via tree-sitter
- May be slow for very large files (>10MB)
- Binary files are not displayed
- Initial view centers on matched line

---

### Code Discovery in Unfamiliar Codebase

**Goal:** Understand how a specific pattern is used

**Steps:**
1. Search broad concept: `cc --tui --sem "database queries" .`
2. Review results in chunks mode
3. Switch to heatmap to see key lines
4. For interesting results, press `f` for full context
5. Press `h` for hybrid mode to narrow to specific keyword
6. Type: "SELECT" to filter to SQL queries
7. Navigate and learn from examples

**Why this works:**
- Start broad with semantic search
- Narrow with hybrid mode and keywords
- Multiple preview modes for different perspectives
- Iterative refinement of understanding

---

### Multi-file Investigation

**Goal:** Track down a bug across multiple files

**Steps:**
1. Search: `cc --tui --sem "authentication token validation" src/`
2. Navigate results
3. Use `y` to copy path of suspicious files
4. Press `Enter` to open first file
5. Return to TUI (relaunch if needed)
6. Modify query: "token expiration"
7. Compare results with previous search
8. Open multiple files in editor tabs

**Why this works:**
- Semantic search finds related authentication code
- Copy paths for tracking
- Iterative queries refine understanding
- Multiple files open for cross-reference

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**EDITOR**
```bash
# Set your preferred editor for the Enter key
export EDITOR=nvim           # Neovim
export EDITOR=vim            # Vim
export EDITOR=code           # VS Code (waits for file to close)
export EDITOR="code -r"      # VS Code (reuse window)
export EDITOR=emacs          # Emacs
export EDITOR=nano           # Nano
```

The TUI uses `$EDITOR` to determine which editor to launch when you press `Enter` on a result. The file will open at the specific line number of the match.

**Terminal Configuration**
```bash
# Ensure proper terminal type (usually automatic)
export TERM=xterm-256color   # 256 color support

# For tmux users
export TERM=screen-256color  # tmux 256 color support
```

**CK-Specific Settings**

```bash
# Custom theme (if supported in future versions)
export CC_THEME=dark

# Clipboard integration (usually automatic)
export CC_CLIPBOARD=enabled
```

---

### Color Scheme

The TUI adapts to your terminal's color scheme:

**Recommended terminals:**
- **macOS**: iTerm2, Alacritty, WezTerm, Terminal.app
- **Linux**: Alacritty, kitty, GNOME Terminal, konsole
- **Windows**: Windows Terminal, Alacritty, WezTerm
- **Cross-platform**: Alacritty, WezTerm

**For best results:**
- Use a terminal with 24-bit true color support
- Dark mode terminals generally work best
- Modern terminal emulators (2020+) recommended
- Ensure `$TERM` is set correctly

**Color capabilities by terminal:**
- ✅ 24-bit color: iTerm2, Alacritty, WezTerm, Windows Terminal
- ✅ 256 color: Most modern terminals
- ⚠️ 16 color: Basic terminals (TUI may look degraded)

---

### .ccignore Configuration

The TUI respects `.ccignore` files for excluding directories and files from search:

```bash
# Example .ccignore
node_modules/
target/
*.log
.git/
```

Place `.ccignore` in your project root or search directory. See [Configuration Reference](configuration.html) for full details.

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Querying

**Good semantic queries (specific, concept-based):**
```
✅ "authentication middleware"      # Specific pattern
✅ "database connection pool"       # Clear concept
✅ "retry mechanism with backoff"   # Detailed pattern
✅ "error propagation"              # Specific technique
✅ "lazy initialization"            # Known pattern
```

**Less effective queries (too vague):**
```
❌ "the code that handles stuff"    # Too vague
❌ "things"                          # Not specific
❌ "good code"                       # Subjective, meaningless
❌ "how to"                          # Too general
```

**Regex pattern tips:**
```
✅ "fn test_\w+"                    # Specific pattern
✅ "TODO|FIXME|XXX"                 # Multiple alternatives
✅ "impl .* for \w+"                # Trait implementations
✅ "async fn.*-> Result"            # Async functions returning results
```

### Performance Tips

**Index management:**
1. **Index once, search many**: First search creates index (~1-2 sec for medium repos)
2. **Reindex when needed**: Delete `.cc/` directory to rebuild index
3. **Exclude large dirs**: Use `.ccignore` for `node_modules`, `target`, etc.

**Search optimization:**
1. **Use regex for exact matches**: Faster than semantic for simple string searches
2. **Narrow your scope**: Search `src/` instead of `.` when possible
3. **Start specific**: Specific queries return fewer, better results

**Preview optimization:**
1. **Full-file mode**: Use sparingly on large files (can be slow to render)
2. **Chunks mode**: Fastest preview mode, good default
3. **Heatmap mode**: Moderate performance, great for skimming

**Large codebase tips:**
- Use `.ccignore` aggressively to exclude irrelevant directories
- Search specific subdirectories instead of entire repo
- Use hybrid mode to combine keyword filtering with semantic ranking
- Consider regex mode for simple searches (no indexing required)

---

### Workflow Optimization

**Set your editor properly:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export EDITOR=nvim
```

**Quick iteration on queries:**
- Use `i` or `/` to edit search without leaving TUI
- Press `Enter` to re-run search
- Iterate rapidly on query refinement

**Choose the right preview mode:**
- **Chunks**: Default, great for understanding structure
- **Heatmap**: Best for finding most relevant lines
- **Full-file**: Use when you need complete context

**Keyboard efficiency:**
- Learn `j`/`k` navigation (faster than arrow keys)
- Use `g`/`G` for quick jumps to top/bottom
- `Ctrl+d`/`Ctrl+u` for page navigation
- Press `y` to copy paths as you browse

**Multi-file workflows:**
1. Note interesting results mentally or with `y` (copy path)
2. Open each in new editor tab/split
3. Use clipboard history to track copied paths
4. Return to TUI for more exploration

---

### Advanced Techniques

**Combining search modes:**
1. Start with semantic to explore broadly
2. Switch to hybrid to narrow with keywords
3. Use regex for exact pattern refinement

**Using heatmap for learning:**
- Search for a pattern you want to understand
- Heatmap shows which lines are most relevant to the concept
- Learn from the highest-scored lines
- Compare across multiple implementations

**Full-file exploration:**
- Use full-file to understand imports and dependencies
- See how matched code relates to surrounding functions
- Understand module structure and organization
- Find related functionality nearby

**Clipboard workflow:**
1. Use `y` to copy paths as you explore
2. Paste into a TODO list or notes
3. Track investigation paths
4. Share interesting findings with team

---

## Troubleshooting

### TUI not launching

**Symptoms:**
- TUI doesn't appear
- Terminal shows garbled output
- Immediate crash or error

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check terminal compatibility
echo $TERM
# Should output: xterm-256color, screen-256color, etc.

# Try explicit TERM setting
TERM=xterm-256color cc --tui .

# Verify terminal supports TUI
tput colors
# Should output: 256 or higher

# Update terminal emulator
# Ensure you're using a modern terminal (2020+)
```

**Common causes:**
- Very old terminal emulator
- SSH session without proper TERM forwarding
- Terminal doesn't support required features

**Workarounds:**
- Use CLI mode instead: `cc --sem "query" .`
- Upgrade terminal emulator
- Use local terminal instead of SSH

---

### Slow scrolling in full-file mode

**Symptoms:**
- Laggy scrolling with `j`/`k`
- TUI feels unresponsive in full-file preview
- High CPU usage

**Solutions:**
1. Switch to chunks or heatmap mode (press `m`)
2. Use regex mode for very large files
3. Narrow search scope to smaller directories
4. Exclude large files with `.ccignore`

**Why it happens:**
- Very large files (>10MB) are slow to render
- Syntax highlighting is CPU-intensive
- Full-file mode loads entire file into memory

---

### Search not finding anything

**Symptoms:**
- No results despite knowing file exists
- Expected matches don't appear
- Empty results list

**Debugging steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check mode indicator (top-right)
#    Ensure you're in the right mode (semantic/regex/hybrid)

# 2. Verify index exists
ls .cc/
# Should show index files; if not, first search creates it

# 3. Try regex mode to confirm file exists
# Press 'r' then search for a known string

# 4. Check .gitignore/.ccignore
cat .gitignore .ccignore
# Look for patterns that might exclude your target files

# 5. Verify file is text (not binary)
file path/to/target.txt
# Should say "text" not "binary"
```

**Common causes:**
- Wrong search mode (semantic vs regex)
- File excluded by `.gitignore` or `.ccignore`
- Binary file (TUI only searches text)
- Typo in search query
- File outside search directory

---

### Preview not showing

**Symptoms:**
- Preview pane is blank or says "No preview available"
- File path shown but no content
- Error in preview area

**Causes and solutions:**

**Binary files:**
- TUI only previews text files
- Solution: Open in editor with `Enter` to use appropriate tool

**Very large files:**
- Files >10MB may not preview
- Solution: Open in editor or use CLI mode

**Permission issues:**
- File not readable by current user
- Solution: Check file permissions with `ls -l`

**Encoding issues:**
- Non-UTF8 files may not display correctly
- Solution: Convert to UTF8 or open in specialized editor

**Workaround:**
- Always possible to open in editor with `Enter`
- Copy path with `y` and open manually

---

### Index out of date

**Symptoms:**
- New files don't appear in results
- Deleted files still show up
- Recent changes not reflected

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Delete index to force rebuild
rm -rf .cc/

# Re-run search (will rebuild index)
cc --tui .

# Or use CLI to force reindex
cc --reindex .
```

**When to reindex:**
- After major code changes
- After switching branches
- After pulling large updates
- When index seems stale

---

### Clipboard not working

**Symptoms:**
- `y` key doesn't copy path
- No clipboard content after pressing `y`

**Platform-specific solutions:**

**macOS:**
```bash
# Usually works out of the box
# Verify pbcopy is available
which pbcopy
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install xclip or xsel
sudo apt install xclip
# or
sudo apt install xsel

# Verify installation
which xclip
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Usually works in Windows Terminal
# Verify clip.exe is available
where clip
```

**Workarounds:**
- Manually copy path from results list
- Use mouse selection (if terminal supports it)
- Open file and copy path from editor

---

### Performance issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow search results
- High CPU usage
- Long index creation time

**Solutions:**

```bash
# 1. Exclude large directories
echo "node_modules/" >> .ccignore
echo "target/" >> .ccignore
echo ".git/" >> .ccignore

# 2. Search specific subdirectories
cc --tui src/           # Instead of .

# 3. Use regex for simple searches
# Press 'r' for regex mode (no indexing)

# 4. Check index size
du -sh .cc/
# Very large indexes indicate too much is indexed
```

**Performance expectations:**
- Small repos (<1K files): Instant indexing
- Medium repos (1K-10K files): 1-2 seconds
- Large repos (10K-100K files): 5-30 seconds
- Very large repos (>100K files): Consider selective indexing

## Advanced Features

### Multi-file Navigation

**Workflow:**
1. Search for pattern
2. Use `y` to copy paths of interesting results
3. Open each in new editor tab/split
4. Build mental map of related files
5. Cross-reference between files

**Example:**
```bash
# In TUI, search for "authentication"
# Press 'y' on: src/auth.rs
# Press 'y' on: src/middleware/auth.rs
# Press 'y' on: tests/auth_test.rs
# Open all three in editor tabs for comparison
```

---

### Comparing Implementations

**Goal:** See how different parts of codebase handle the same pattern

**Workflow:**
1. Search for pattern: "rate limiting"
2. Use heatmap to identify key implementation lines
3. Navigate through multiple results
4. Compare highest-scored sections
5. Learn from best examples

**Benefits:**
- Discover best practices in your own codebase
- Find inconsistencies in implementation
- Learn different approaches to same problem
- Standardize on best approach

---

### Code Discovery and Learning

**Use semantic search to learn unfamiliar codebases:**

```bash
# How is logging done?
cc --tui --sem "logging"

# How are configs loaded?
cc --tui --sem "configuration loading"

# How are errors handled?
cc --tui --sem "error handling patterns"

# How are tests structured?
cc --tui --sem "test fixtures and setup"

# How is state managed?
cc --tui --sem "state management"
```

**Learning workflow:**
1. Search broad concept
2. Review high-scored results
3. Use chunks mode to see structure
4. Use full-file mode for context
5. Open interesting examples in editor
6. Iterate and refine query

---

### Iterative Query Refinement

**Technique:** Start broad, narrow progressively

**Example:**
```
1. Search: "database"           (too broad, 500 results)
2. Refine: "database queries"   (better, 100 results)
3. Switch to hybrid: "SELECT"   (very specific, 20 results)
4. Find exactly what you need
```

**Strategy:**
- Start with semantic search for exploration
- Switch to hybrid to add keyword requirements
- Use regex for final precise filtering
- Cycle preview modes to understand results
