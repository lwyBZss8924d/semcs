# Unexpected Behaviors in cc

This file tracks instances where cc behaves unexpectedly during testing or usage.

## Format

**Command:** `command run`  
**Expected:** What should have happened  
**Actual:** What actually happened  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** [Fixed/Open/Investigating]

---

## Issues Found

**Command:** `cc ""`
**Expected:** Error message or no results
**Actual:** Massive output with every empty line in the codebase being matched
**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Status:** Open
**Notes:** Empty pattern matches all empty lines, resulting in overwhelming output. Perhaps should warn or limit results?

**Command:** `cc --add /tmp/test.txt`
**Expected:** Add file to index or meaningful error
**Actual:** Error: "No file specified. Usage: cc --add <file>"
**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Status:** Open
**Notes:** The error message is incorrect - a file was specified. Seems like argument parsing issue.

**Command:** `cc --sem "ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦€âœ¨"`
**Expected:** No results or error about emoji patterns
**Actual:** Returns seemingly random code results
**Date:** 2025-09-13
